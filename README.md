# Graduation-Project
Project talks about an ethical pen-test to our academy (Modern Academy in Egypt).
# INTRODUCTION
This project is a combination between network administration and network security , Our team works on modern
academy computer science branch to improve the performance of the network to achieve the highest performance
that can be achieved , we set a network design that contains active path of the network and passive one to be sure
that there is no likely malfunction on the network level.
We have tried hard to achieve network security at the Layer 2 level to stop layer 2 attacks because of its extreme
importance because it is directly connected to the end points.
In a security level , we have attacked the current network of the collage , we get a lot of vulnerabilities and we have
completed a security report that helped us to create the appropriate design with high level security and
SOC technologies.
The objective of this project was to conduct an in-depth penetration testing of the website owned by our academy,
aimed at identifying vulnerabilities and weaknesses within its infrastructure and applications.
The ultimate goal was to enhance the security posture of the website to mitigate potential risks of unauthorized
access, data breaches, and other cyber threats.
