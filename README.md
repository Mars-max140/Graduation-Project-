# Graduation-Project
Project talks about an ethical pen-test to our academy (Modern Academy in Egypt).
# INTRODUCTION
This project is a combination between network administration and network security , Our team works on modern
academy computer science branch to improve the performance of the network to achieve the highest performance
that can be achieved , we set a network design that contains active path of the network and passive one to be sure
that there is no likely malfunction on the network level.
We have tried hard to achieve network security at the Layer 2 level to stop layer 2 attacks because of its extreme
importance because it is directly connected to the end points.
In a security level , we have attacked the current network of the collage , we get a lot of vulnerabilities and we have
completed a security report that helped us to create the appropriate design with high level security and
SOC technologies.
The objective of this project was to conduct an in-depth penetration testing of the website owned by our academy,
aimed at identifying vulnerabilities and weaknesses within its infrastructure and applications.
The ultimate goal was to enhance the security posture of the website to mitigate potential risks of unauthorized
access, data breaches, and other cyber threats.
# SCOPE AND METHODOLOGY
Our approach was meticulously designed to ensure comprehensive coverage of potential threats and
vulnerabilities. We adopted a multi-faceted methodology, incorporating the following key stages:
Reconnaissance: Delving into the website's architecture, identifying potential entry points, and assessing
the technology stack.
Vulnerability Scanning: Leveraging automated tools to scan for known vulnerabilities, misconfigurations,
and weaknesses in the website's defenses.
Manual Testing: Supplementing automated scans with manual probing to uncover nuanced vulnerabilities
that evade automated detection.
Exploitation: Simulating real-world attacks to exploit identified vulnerabilities and ascertain their severity
and potential impact.
Reporting: Methodically documenting findings, categorizing vulnerabilities, and formulating actionable
recommendations for mitigation.
# METHODOLOGY
The penetration testing process followed a structured methodology, encompassing
the following phases:
Preparation: This phase involved gathering information about the website, its infrastructure,
technologies used, and potential attack vectors. Information gathering techniques such as
passive reconnaissance, WHOIS lookup, and DNS enumeration were employed.
Scanning: Utilizing automated scanning tools such as Nmap, Nessus, and OpenVAS to identify
open ports, services running, and potential vulnerabilities.
Both network and web application scanners were utilized to comprehensively assess the
website's attack surface.
Enumeration: Further enumerating details about the services and systems discovered during
the scanning phase to gain a deeper understanding of the network.
Techniques such as SNMP enumeration, DNS zone transfers, and LDAP queries were employed
to gather additional information.
Vulnerability Assessment: Conducting thorough vulnerability scans using both automated and
manual techniques to identify weaknesses in the website's configuration, software versions,
and other potential security flaws.
Common vulnerabilities such as outdated software, misconfigurations, and insecure
permissions were assessed.
Exploitation: Attempting to exploit identified vulnerabilities to assess their severity and
potential impact.
Techniques such as Metasploit framework, SQL injection, and cross-site scripting (XSS) were
utilized to simulate real-world attacks and ascertain the level of risk posed by the vulnerabilities.
Post-Exploitation: Analyzing the consequences of successful exploitation and assessing the level
of access gained.
Techniques such as privilege escalation, lateral movement, and data exfiltration were performed
to simulate advanced persistent threats (APTs) and assess the resilience of the website's defenses.
Documentation: Documenting all findings, including vulnerabilities discovered, their severity
level (based on CVSS score), and recommended remediation steps.
A detailed report was prepared, outlining the findings, potential impact, and actionable
recommendations for improving the website's security posture.
