No Signal Attack " Works "

Attack Scenario
---------------

. After the Information Gathering we need to load on a server and firewall

. We load by TCP-SYN flood DOS attack by hping3

. The firewall of Academy Block us because detected there is unauthorized connections from our IP
based on a high request we send

. We make a Proxychains to make a fake of many IPs and hide our location that make the cloudflare
server accept our request

. Now we DOS attack and make a high load request on a DNS high load to make a server out
on a Modern website

. By the (setoolkit) a phishing attack we edit on this tool that we make us to connect with a real
server after the client (student) connect to modern (http://mng.modern-academy.edu.eg)

. We have chosen a right tine to have a load of students in Modern website, which causes the
load on a server that help us to make our attack to 1) collect more data 2) Already there was
a load on a server

. After the student go to the website we attack it by DOS and by setoolkit connect the our
website to Phishing him and if he login his ID & Password send to us and now we make him
to go to the real server

. We use all vulnerability of protocol that we know from the information gathering.

. We are fully aware of what we are doing and all things we review with our supervisor.

. All data that we collected from users (students) we taken their permissions that the attack
would be carried out on them

. At the end Network-X our team goals we discovers all vulnerability and threats to make a
high secure connection of our College Modern Academy for Computer Science
